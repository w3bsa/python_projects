# IP address logging script
 
I was interested to track the IP address leased to me by my ISP in order to understand how frequently this was changed, if at all.

I plan to expand this project at some point, so that if my IP changes this script will update the IP address in my domain's DNS records - allowing my domain to resolve to the correct and current IP, behind which my public facing services can be found.
